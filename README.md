# Meta Learning

This contains implementation of different type of meta-learners and their comparison. The [course](https://sites.google.com/view/meta-learning-2021/home) is taken by **[Dr. Gautam Shroff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautam-shroff-066901/?originalSubdomain=in)**. 

## Different types of Meta-Learners

1. **[MAML](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf)** (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning):- a optimisation based meta-learner:- Requires second order derivatives. 
2. **[CNP](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/garnelo18a/garnelo18a.pdf)** (Conditional Neural Processes):- model-based meta-learner.
3. **[MAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080)** (Matching Networks):- metric-based meta-learner. Great for one-shot learning.
4. **[Gated Linear Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01526.pdf)**:- for Continual Learning.
