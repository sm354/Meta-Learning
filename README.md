# Meta Learning

This contains implementation of different type of meta-learners and their comparison. The [course](https://sites.google.com/view/meta-learning-2021/home) is taken by **[Dr. Gautam Shroff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautam-shroff-066901/?originalSubdomain=in)**. 

## Different types of Meta-Learners

1. **[MAML](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf)**:- a optimisation based meta-learner. Requires second order derivatives. [Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning ](./nb1 MAML.ipynb)
2. **[CNP](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/garnelo18a/garnelo18a.pdf)**:- model-based meta-learner.  [Conditional Neural Processes](./nb2 CNP.ipynb)
3. **[MAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080)**:- metric-based meta-learner. Great for one-shot learning. [Matching Networks](./nb3 MAN.ipynb)
4. **[Gated Linear Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01526.pdf)**:- for Continual Learning. [GLN](./nb4 GLN.ipynb)
